# NinjaFood website using tailwind.css
Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives 
you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without 
any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

I created this with the help of The Net Ninja [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg].
This is a mobile approach first and is responsive to fit any screen.

## Things you should understand: 
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Flexbox
* Grid
* node.js


## Installation:.You 
The main thing that you need to have is node.js [https://nodejs.org/en/].
You need node because of npm in the command line.
